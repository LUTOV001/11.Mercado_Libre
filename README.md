## **Installation Guide**

### 1. [prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) : Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well. Prophet is open source software released by Facebookâ€™s Core Data Science team. It is available for download on CRAN and PyPI. Install in your environment following the steps below:
#### 1.1. Open the GitBash terminal
#### 1.2 Type the following command and press Enter:
```python 
pip install prophet
```
### *Note: The above installation instructions are for the Prophet to work locally in a Windows computer; if Prophet does not work locally, virtual environment options, such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) can be utilized.*

### 2. [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) : hvplot is a Python library that provides a high-level interface for creating interactive and visually appealing visualizations. It is built on top of HoloViews and provides a simplified API for generating plots directly from Pandas DataFrames, GeoPandas DataFrames, xarray datasets, and other data structures commonly used in the PyData ecosystem. To install, follow these steps:
#### 2.1. Open the GitBash terminal
#### 2.2 Type the following command and press Enter:
```python 
pip install hvplot
```
